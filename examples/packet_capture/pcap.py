# This script demonstrates how to perform an on-demand packet capture on a sensor.
# It shows how to:
#  - Start a packet capture on the /on-demand-tests/sensors/{sensorId}/packet-capture endpoint
#  - Poll the capture status until it completes or fails
#  - Download the resulting pcap file locally
